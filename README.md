# bilateral_asymmetry
## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create an alternative way to analyze data that I've been collecting in a research project that is attempting to create standard lower extremity (LE) bilateral asymmetry values for healthy individuals to be applied to individuals rehabbing LE injuries. Specifically, this project takes all the separate data files and collects them by subject into one object. From here you can make asymmetry reports for a single subject investigating individual percent asymmetries in limb movements, or you can create an object that looks at all participants and summarizes this data.

## Approach: 
All data for this project has been collected in the biomechanics labs on campus and is stored in personal Excel files. It has also used the packages Pandas + openpyxl, unittest, FPDF, and datetime.
