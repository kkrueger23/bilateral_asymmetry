Bilateral limb asymmetry is a measure frequently used in rehabilitation strength training as a way to ensure that an individual is capable of participating in normal exercise activities. While it is frequently used in practice and in literature to show strength, range of motion, and power discrepancies, to date there is limited research on what normative asymmetry values may look like. The purpose of this project is to collect data on limb asymmetry during standard rehabilitation exercises to create a normative measure of asymmetry amongst healthy adult that can be applied to a rehabilitation setting.
